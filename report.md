## YSO Science and Classes
Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are in the early stages of stellar evolution. They are formed when a molecular cloud collapses, leading to the birth of a star and its surrounding protoplanetary disk.  
There are three primary classes of YSOs, which are based on their luminosity and spectral characteristics:  
- **Class I**: The youngest, characterized by high luminosity and a prominent accretion disk.  
- **Class II**: These stars have formed more clearly, with a protoplanetary disk still present but with less material accreting onto the star.  
- **Class III**: These stars are nearing the end of their formation phase, with little to no accretion disk left.  
YSOs are key to understanding star formation processes and the evolution of planetary systems.  

## Accretion Bursts and How to Detect Them
Accretion bursts are sudden, brief increases in luminosity caused by material falling onto a young star from its surrounding disk. These bursts occur in the early stages of stellar formation when material from the protoplanetary disk is channeled into the star, creating short-term spikes in brightness.  
### How to detect accretion bursts:  
- **Light Curves**: Variations in brightness over time are analyzed to detect accretion bursts.  
- **Infrared Observations**: These bursts are often detected in infrared bands, as the energy released is typically thermal radiation.  
Accretion bursts are important because they provide insights into the accretion process, which is fundamental to star and planet formation.  

## SED and Spectroscopy (Light Curves)
The **Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)** represents the energy emitted by an astronomical object across various wavelengths of light. For YSOs, their SED is a crucial diagnostic tool that reveals details about their age, mass, and the nature of their surrounding material.  
### Light Curves  
A **light curve** is a plot of an object's brightness over time. By studying the shape and variations in a light curve, astronomers can infer:  
- Periodicity: Indicating the presence of accretion.  
- Transients: Sudden changes in brightness, like accretion bursts or outflows.  
Spectroscopy allows for the detailed study of the spectral lines in light curves, helping to identify elements in the starâ€™s atmosphere or its accretion disk.  
### Key Data for YSOs:  
- Infrared excess emission in the SED often indicates the presence of dust and gas in the surrounding protoplanetary disk.  

## LLST and Data Sets
LLST (Large-scale Light Curve Survey Telescope) is a hypothetical survey dedicated to observing the variability of celestial objects over a long period of time. Such data can help astronomers monitor YSOs and other variable stars, providing valuable information about their evolution.  
Large datasets collected by LLST could include:  
- Time-series data from continuous monitoring of YSOs.  
- Information about spectral features observed during bursts or flares.  
### Key Data Processing:  
- **Data cleaning**: Removing noise and outliers.  
- **Data fitting**: Fitting models to light curves for better understanding of physical processes.  

## Results
In this study, we will analyze the light curves of several YSOs to detect accretion bursts and identify key features in their SED. By comparing these results with theoretical models of star formation, we aim to improve our understanding of YSO evolution.  

## Conclusion
YSOs are important objects for studying star formation, and accretion bursts play a key role in their evolution. By analyzing light curves and SEDs, we can gain insights into the physical processes occurring in these objects.  

## Cross-sectional skills
The ability to analyze time-series data (light curves), process spectral data, and apply machine learning models to identify accretion bursts are essential skills in modern astronomy. By mastering these techniques, astronomers can improve our understanding of the dynamic processes occurring in young stellar objects.
