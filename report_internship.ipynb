    "# **Variability of Young Stellar Objects — Internship Report**  \n",
    "**Author:** Chiara Virzì  \n",
    "**Date:** April 2025\n",
    "\n",
    " The focus of my internship was the analysis of variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), using photometric and spectroscopic data, in preparation for the upcoming Rubin LSST (Legacy Survey of Space and Time).\n",
    "\n",
    "# **1. Introduction**  \n",
    "The aim of this report is to study spectral and photometric variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) with a focus on the Hα emission line, across timescales of several months.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **2. Young Stellar Object Science**  \n",
    "YSOs are stars in their early formation stages. These stars are known for their strong variability, driven by accretion, magnetic activity, and interactions with surrounding circumstellar material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **YSO Evolutionary Classes**  \n",
    "The evolutionary stages of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are commonly classified based on the overall shape and key features of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which plot energy as a function of frequency or wavelength.\n",
    "These are the types of classes:\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Class 0**: Deeply embedded protostars, observed mainly in the submillimeter range.  \n",
    "- **Class I**: Protostars with infalling envelopes, showing strong infrared excess, outflows and jets.  \n",
    "- **Class II**: Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTS) with developed accretion disks and active mass transfer.  \n",
    "- **Class III**: The emission from the disk becomes negligible and the SED resembles a pure stellar photosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better analisys can be found is the article [Interpreting Spectral Energy Distributions from Young Stellar Objects](#YSO). In this report I will focus on class II and class III objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Accretion burst**  \n",
    " Accretion bursts are episodic events where disk material rapidly accretes onto the stellar surface, causing temporary increases in brightness and temperature. During these phases, localized hot spots dominate the UV/blue spectrum. Different photometric bands respond uniquely to these events:\n",
    "\n",
    " **u/g bands** trace hot-spot and shock emission, signaling variability; while **i/r bands** are sensitive to extinction changes and disk occultation (like disk warps).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Variability Timescales** \n",
    "- **Short-term (hours–days)**: magnetic reconnection flares, unstable accretion streams, jet activity.  \n",
    "- **Long-term (months–years)**: eruptive phenomena such as EXors (months-long outbursts, e.g. EX Lupi) and FUors (decade-long outbursts, e.g. FU Orionis).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Light Curves**  \n",
    "Light curves represent the variation in brightness of a star over time and are essential for diagnosing different types of variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). These variations can arise from both periodic and aperiodic processes. Periodic variability is usually linked to stellar rotation, which modulates the observed light due to surface features such as star spots or the presence of inner disk structures like warps. These warps, often induced by magnetic misalignment or instabilities in the circumstellar disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, aperiodic variability is typically associated with stochastic processes like fluctuating accretion rates or variable extinction from circumstellar dust. These processes lead to irregular and unpredictable changes in brightness, often seen as bursts or dips in the light curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, [Zwicky Transient Facility](#ZTF) (ZTF) data  were used as a prototype for the future Rubin LSST data, thanks to their similar cadence and multi-band coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Spectroscopy and the Hα Line**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to photometric diagnostics, spectroscopic indicators (particularly the Hα emission line at 6562.8 Å) play a fundamental role in tracing accretion activity. **Broad Hα profiles** typically indicate fast-moving material associated with magnetospheric accretion or outflows, while **narrow profiles** are often associated with  chromospheric activity, non-accreting sources [Reipurth et al. (1996)](#reipurth1996), or residual sky nebular emission. Furthermore, the Hα 10% width metric has been proposed as a robust indicator of accretion rate in stars with low mass [Natta et al. (2004)](#natta2004), with further refinement by [Venuti et al. (2014)](#venuti2014) to distinguish between accreting and non-accreting objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another diagnostic parameter is the **Full Width at Zero Intensity (FWZI)**, which measures the total width of the emission line from its departure from to its return to the continuum. This parameter serves to calculate the maximum velocity of gas in the line-forming region and is particularly effective in characterizing broad Hα profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Class II and III sources is crucial for studying the late stages of star formation, as they exhibit very distinct Hα emission properties that trace the decline of the accretion activity and the disk evolution. According to [Reipurth et al. (1996)](#reipurth1996), Class II stars show broad Hα profiles, while Class III objects display narrow emission, making the Hα line an important diagnostic tool in distinguishing between accreting and non-accreting systems during transitional phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **3. Rubin LSST and 4MOST**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)** will image the southern sky repeatedly over a ten-year period in six broad photometric bands (*u, g, r, i, z, y*), covering wavelengths from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared (see Figure 1). Its wide field of view and high cadence will enable the discovery and monitoring of transient and variable phenomena, making it ideal for both short-term and long-term variability studies of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/PMVjYOy.jpeg\" width=\"500\"><br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 1: LSST filter transmission curves, including atmospheric and telescope throughput.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Complementing LSST's photometric data, the **4MOST (4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope)** facility, mounted on the VISTA telescope in Chile, will provide large-scale spectroscopic follow-up. This synergy is crucial for time-domain science, enabling simultaneous tracking of light curve variability and spectral line evolution ,particularly the Hα emission line in YSOs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, I focused on the **NGC 2264** a known star-forming region, which was also part of the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic survey. This region was selected as a case study to explore the potential of coordinated LSST–4MOST observations. NGC 2264, due to its well-characterized population of Class II and Class III YSOs, variable accretion behavior, and extensive datasets, is an ideal target to test observing strategies for YSOs science for the Rubin LSST survey framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the best strategies for identifying and classifying YSO variability, star-forming regions like NGC 2264 have been proposed as high-priority targets for both LSST cadence planning and 4MOST follow-up programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Brokers**  \n",
    "Data brokers are real-time platforms that process alert streams from surveys such as LSST.Due to the very high data rate of the LSST alert stream, alerts are distributed only to brokers and not to individual users Their main functions include filtering, cross-matching with existing catalogs, classification of transient events, and distribution of alerts to the scientific community. They provide researchers with immediate access to the photometric data, enabling follow-up and analysis of variable or transient sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I explored some of the brokers proposed by Rubin LSST. I will list them explaining their more interesting characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ANTARES**: allows real-time alert browsing and the ability to \"favorite\" specific objects for continuous monitoring. This is particularly useful for planning spectroscopic follow-up for interesting or unusual variability.It also automatically cross-references each alert with external catalogs. [ANTARES Broker Documentation](#ANTARES)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ALeRCE**: offers light curves, forced photometry, and machine learning–based classifications-there are various type of classifications- with a pipeline capable of distinguishing between 15 different object types. It also allows to retrieve the data of the light curve.  [ALeRCE pipeline](#Alerce)\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Lasair**: it features many filters that allow to identify astronomical objects based on certain characteristics, written by scientific community. Offers the Watchlist that allows you to monitor and see every alert of the objects of interest.[Lasair website](#Lasair)\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Fink**:it perfoms advanced classification based on machine learning , in particular it is very useful for the classification of SN candidates.It allows you to retrieve the data of the light curves.[Fink website](#Fink)\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools currently operate using data from the **Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)**, acting as functional prototypes for future LSST operations. The ability to utilize both brokers was particularly valuable for this study, as their complementary approaches and toolsets provided a more complete picture of the variability patterns in YSO candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **4. Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Study of Variability**  \n",
    "The following workflow simulates ,what in the future will be, a Rubin-broker-spectroscopy pipeline to evaluate variability in a YSO candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Alert Selection**  \n",
    "I selected in antares a YSO candidate from the ANTARES broker and marked it as a favorite for continuous monitoring (Figure 2).\n",

    "There are few examples of EXor-type, but with the LSST survey it will be possible to discover new objects.\n",

    "So the Rubin LSST will revolutionize YSO studies by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discovering large populations of EXor-type outbursts (months-long events)  \n",
    "- Enabling statistical analyses of episodic accretion across clusters  \n",
    "- Facilitating prompt spectroscopic follow-up via broker alerts and 4MOST  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Discussion and Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents a simulation of the future Rubin LSST–4MOST synergy, focusing on the analysis of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the NGC 2264 region. I investigated both photometric and spectroscopic variability, using the Hα emission line and nearby forbidden lines as diagnostic tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to verify the variability of a YSO by monitoring how its Hα line evolves over time. Moving toward a more quantitative analysis, I examined the spectra of two distinct objects. The first object represents a medium case: in particular, its sky-subtracted spectrum exhibited absorption features likely caused by over-subtraction, while the corresponding non-sky-subtracted spectrum was also unsuitable for further analysis due to dominant nebular emission overpowering the stellar signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the second object—deliberately selected as a good case—presents two nearly identical spectra. Furthermore, the region most affected by nebular contamination does not interfere with our diagnostic line, thereby confirming the reliability of the data. Proceeding with a more detailed analysis, I calculated several physical parameters of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, I focused on the mass accretion rate, adapting existing calibrations to our specific case using data collected from the VizieR catalog of [Bonito et al. (2020)](#bonito2020). Using FWZI I developed a custom calibration for the mass accretion rate and applied it to well-classified sources, obtaining consistent and meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of analysis enables rapid classification of cluster members, significantly reducing the volume of data that requires deeper examination.\n",
    "Although this methodology was demonstrated using only two objects, it represents a potentially powerful tool for statistically identifying accretors across large stellar populations.\n",
