    "# **Variability of Young Stellar Objects — Internship Report**  \n",
    "**Author:** Chiara Virzì  \n",
    "**Date:** April 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This report outlines the work I conducted during my internship under the supervision of Dr. Rosaria Bonito at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo. The focus of the internship was the analysis of variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), using both photometric and spectroscopic data, in preparation for the upcoming Rubin LSST survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **1. Introduction**  \n",
    "The aim of this project is to study spectral variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), with a focus on the Hα emission line, across timescales of several months. As a Rubin LSST data rights holder, I developed methods to identify accretion signatures in archival spectra and correlated these features with photometric variability. The Hα line serves as a key diagnostic for accretion processes, mass-loss activity, and the evolutionary stages of pre-main-sequence stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "# **2. Young Stellar Object Science**  \n",
    "YSOs are stars in their early formation stages, still undergoing contraction and typically surrounded by disks of gas and dust. These stars are known for their strong variability, driven by accretion, magnetic activity, and interactions with surrounding circumstellar material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **YSO Evolutionary Classes**  \n",
    "YSOs are classified based on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and infrared excess:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class 0**: Deeply embedded protostars, observed mainly in the submillimeter range.  \n",
    "- **Class I**: Protostars with infalling envelopes, showing strong infrared excess and outflows.  \n",
    "- **Class II**: Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTS) with developed accretion disks and active mass transfer.  \n",
    "- **Class III**: Weak-lined T Tauri Stars (WTTS) with little or no disk and minimal accretion signatures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Class II and III sources is crucial for studying late-stage star formation and early disk evolution—key elements for understanding planet formation. [4](#ref4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Accretion Bursts**  \n",
    "Accretion bursts are episodic events in which disk material rapidly accretes onto the stellar surface, temporarily increasing brightness and temperature. Localized hot spots dominate the UV/blue spectrum during these events.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Different photometric bands respond uniquely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **u/g bands**: Trace hot-spot and shock emission.  \n",
    "- **i/z bands**: Sensitive to extinction changes and disk occultation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Short-Term Variability**  \n",
    "Occurs over hours to days, driven by magnetic flares, unstable accretion streams, or jet activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Long-Term Variability**  \n",
    "Occurs over months to years, including EXor-type (months-long) and FUor-type (decades-long) outbursts.In particular EXors, characterized by episodic accretion outbursts lasting months to years, are still poorly understood due to the rarity of available samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Light Curves**  \n",
    "Light curves record brightness vs. time, revealing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Periodic variability** from rotation or disk warps.  \n",
    "- **Aperiodic variability** from changing accretion or extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, ZTF light curves were cross-matched with Hα spectroscopic diagnostics to identify correlated variability. [12](#ref12)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Spectroscopy and the Hα Line**  \n",
    "The Hα line at 6562.8 Å provides direct insight into accretion and wind phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broad/asymmetric profiles** indicate magnetospheric infall or outflow.  \n",
    "- **Narrow/symmetric profiles** indicate chromospheric emission.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Full Width at Zero Intensity (FWZI) measures the total emission-line width—from continuum departure to return—and serves as a proxy for maximum gas velocities in the line-forming region.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **3. Rubin LSST and 4MOST**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Rubin Observatory’s LSST** (Legacy Survey of Space and Time) will image the sky in six bands (*u, g, r, i, z, y*) over ten years, enabling both short- and long-term variability studies.  \n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **4MOST** facility will provide time-resolved spectroscopy for variable-source follow-up. In this study, the NGC 2264 region—also observed by Gaia-ESO—serves as a testbed for the Rubin–4MOST synergy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Brokers**  \n",
    "Real-time brokers (ANTARES, ALeRCE) filter and classify survey alerts, providing light curves, forced photometry, and ML-based object classification to facilitate follow-up observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **4. Methods**\n",

    "## **Temporal Study of Variability**  \n",
    "We implemented a pipeline that:\n",

    "1. Selects alerts in ANTARES and favorites the target.  \n",
    "2. Retrieves light curves and classifications from ALeRCE.  \n",
    "3. Analyzes photometric variability patterns.  \n",

    "\n",

This behavior was previously reported by [Bonito et al. (2020)](#bonito2020), and is consistent with known variability patterns in young stellar objects.  \n",
    "The spectra used in this step were pre-normalized and pre-trimmed by Dr. Bonito.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I performed a quantitative comparison between sky-subtracted and non-sky-subtracted spectra from the Gaia-ESO Survey (Data Release 4) for NGC 2264.

    "The Rubin LSST will revolutionize YSO studies by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discovering large populations of EXor-type outbursts (months-long events)  \n",
    "- Enabling statistical analyses of episodic accretion across clusters  \n",
    "- Facilitating prompt spectroscopic follow-up via broker alerts and 4MOST  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Discussion and Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents a simulation of the future Rubin LSST–4MOST synergy, focusing on the analysis of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the NGC 2264 region. I investigated both photometric and spectroscopic variability, using the Hα emission line and nearby forbidden lines as diagnostic tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to verify the variability of a YSO by monitoring how its Hα line evolves over time. Moving toward a more quantitative analysis, I examined the spectra of two distinct objects. The first object represents a bad case: in particular, its sky-subtracted spectrum exhibited absorption features likely caused by over-subtraction, while the corresponding non-sky-subtracted spectrum was also unsuitable for further analysis due to dominant nebular noise overpowering the stellar signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of analysis enables rapid classification of cluster members, significantly reducing the volume of data that requires deeper examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the second object—deliberately selected as a good case—presents two nearly identical spectra. Furthermore, the region most affected by nebular contamination does not interfere with our diagnostic line, thereby confirming the reliability of the data. Proceeding with a more detailed analysis, I calculated several physical parameters of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, I focused on the mass accretion rate, adapting existing calibrations to our specific case using data collected from the VizieR catalog of Bonito et al. (2020). Using FWZI as a proxy for accretion, we developed a custom calibration for the mass accretion rate and applied it to well-classified sources, obtaining consistent and meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this methodology was demonstrated using only two objects, it represents a potentially powerful tool for statistically identifying accretors across large stellar populations.\n",
