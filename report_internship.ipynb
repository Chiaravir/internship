    "# **Variability of Young Stellar Objects — Internship Report**  \n",
    "**Author:** Chiara Virzì  \n",
    "**Date:** April 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of my internship was the analysis of variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), using photometric and spectroscopic data, in preparation for the upcoming Rubin LSST (Legacy Survey of Space and Time).\n",
    "\n",
    "# **1. Introduction**  \n",
    "The aim of this report is to study spectral and photometric variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) with a focus on the Hα emission line, across timescales of several months.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **2. Young Stellar Object Science**  \n",
    "YSOs are stars in their early formation stages. These stars are known for their strong variability, driven by accretion, magnetic activity, and interactions with surrounding circumstellar material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **YSO Evolutionary Classes**  \n",
    "The evolutionary stages of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are commonly classified based on the overall shape and key features of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which plot energy as a function of frequency or wavelength.\n",
    "These are the types of classes:\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Class 0**: Deeply embedded protostars, observed mainly in the submillimeter range.  \n",
    "- **Class I**: Protostars with infalling envelopes, showing strong infrared excess, outflows and jets.  \n",
    "- **Class II**: Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTS) with developed accretion disks and active mass transfer.  \n",
    "- **Class III**: The emission from the disk becomes negligible and the SED resembles a pure stellar photosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better analysis can be found in the article [Interpreting Spectral Energy Distributions from Young Stellar Objects](#YSO). In this report I will focus on Class II and Class III objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Accretion burst**  \n",
    "Accretion bursts are episodic events where disk material rapidly accretes onto the stellar surface, causing temporary increases in brightness and temperature. During these phases, localized hot spots dominate the UV/blue spectrum. Different photometric bands respond uniquely to these events:\n",
    "\n",
    "**u/g bands** trace hot-spot and shock emission, signaling variability; while **i/r bands** are sensitive to extinction changes and disk occultation (like disk warps).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Variability Timescales** \n",
    "- **Short-term (hours–days)**: magnetic reconnection flares, unstable accretion streams, jet activity.  \n",
    "- **Long-term (months–years)**: eruptive phenomena such as EXors (months-long outbursts, e.g. EX Lupi) and FUors (decade-long outbursts, e.g. FU Orionis).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Light Curves**  \n",
    "Light curves represent the variation in brightness of a star over time and are essential for diagnosing different types of variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). These variations can arise from both periodic and aperiodic processes. Periodic variability is usually linked to stellar rotation, which modulates the observed light due to surface features such as star spots or the presence of inner disk structures like warps. These warps, often induced by magnetic misalignment or instabilities in the circumstellar disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, aperiodic variability is typically associated with stochastic processes like fluctuating accretion rates or variable extinction from circumstellar dust. These processes lead to irregular and unpredictable changes in brightness, often seen as bursts or dips in the light curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, [Zwicky Transient Facility](#ZTF) (ZTF) data were used as a prototype for the future Rubin LSST data, thanks to their similar cadence and multi-band coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Spectroscopy and the Hα Line**  \n",
    "In addition to photometric diagnostics, spectroscopic indicators (particularly the Hα emission line at 6562.8 Å) play a fundamental role in tracing accretion activity. **Broad Hα profiles** typically indicate fast-moving material associated with magnetospheric accretion or outflows, while **narrow profiles** are often associated with chromospheric activity, non-accreting sources [Reipurth et al. (1996)](#reipurth1996), or residual sky nebular emission.\n",
    "Furthermore, the Hα 10% width metric has been proposed as a robust indicator of accretion rate in stars with low mass [Natta et al. (2004)](#natta2004), with further refinement by [Venuti et al. (2014)](#venuti2014) to distinguish between accreting and non-accreting objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another diagnostic parameter is the **Full Width at Zero Intensity (FWZI)**, which measures the total width of the emission line from its departure from to its return to the continuum. This parameter serves to calculate the maximum velocity of gas in the line-forming region and is particularly effective in characterizing broad Hα profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Class II and III sources is crucial for studying the late stages of star formation, as they exhibit very distinct Hα emission properties that trace the decline of the accretion activity and the disk evolution.\n",
    "According to [Reipurth et al. (1996)](#reipurth1996), Class II stars show broad Hα profiles, while Class III objects display narrow emission, making the Hα line an important diagnostic tool in distinguishing between accreting and non-accreting systems during transitional phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **3. Rubin LSST and 4MOST**  \n",
    "The **Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)** will image the southern sky repeatedly over a ten-year period in six broad photometric bands (*u, g, r, i, z, y*), covering wavelengths from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared (see Figure 1). Its wide field of view and high cadence will enable the discovery and monitoring of transient and variable phenomena, making it ideal for both short-term and long-term variability studies of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/PMVjYOy.jpeg\" width=\"500\"><br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 1: LSST filter transmission curves, including atmospheric and telescope throughput.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Complementing LSST's photometric data, the **4MOST (4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope)** facility, mounted on the VISTA telescope in Chile, will provide large-scale spectroscopic follow-up. This synergy is crucial for time-domain science, enabling simultaneous tracking of light curve variability and spectral line evolution, particularly the Hα emission line in YSOs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, I focused on **NGC 2264**, a well-known star-forming region that was also part of the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic survey. This region was selected as a case study to explore the potential of coordinated LSST–4MOST observations. Due to its well-characterized population of Class II and Class III YSOs, variable accretion behavior, and extensive datasets, NGC 2264 is an ideal target to test observing strategies for YSO science within the Rubin LSST framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate optimal strategies for identifying and classifying YSO variability, star-forming regions like NGC 2264 have been proposed as high-priority targets for both LSST cadence planning and 4MOST follow-up programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Brokers**  \n",
    "Data brokers are real-time platforms that process alert streams from surveys such as LSST. They are a fundamental component of the LSST survey. The Rubin Observatory will generate up to 10 million alerts per night, so their task will be to act as the primary scientific interface between the LSST alert stream and the astronomical community.\n",
    "Their main functions include filtering, cross-matching with existing catalogs, classification of transient events, and distribution of alerts to the scientific community.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I explored several brokers proposed by Rubin LSST:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ANTARES**: Allows real-time alert browsing and the ability to \"favorite\" specific objects for continuous monitoring. It also automatically cross-references each alert with external catalogs. [ANTARES Broker Documentation](#ANTARES)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ALeRCE**: Provides light curves, forced photometry, and machine-learning classifications with a pipeline capable of distinguishing between 15 object types. It also allows downloading light curve data. [ALeRCE pipeline](#Alerce)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lasair**: Features many community-written filters that identify astronomical objects based on specific characteristics. It also offers a Watchlist tool to monitor alerts for selected targets. [Lasair website](#Lasair)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fink**: Performs advanced machine-learning–based classification, particularly effective for SN candidates. It also allows downloading light curve data. [Fink website](#Fink)\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools currently operate using data from the **Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)**, acting as functional prototypes for future LSST operations. Using multiple brokers was particularly valuable, as their complementary features provided a more complete view of YSO variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **4. Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Study of Variability**  \n",
    "The following workflow simulates what will eventually become a Rubin–broker–spectroscopy pipeline to evaluate variability in a YSO candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Alert Selection**  \n",
    "I selected a YSO candidate from the broker ANTARES and marked it as a favorite for continuous monitoring, to see eventual alerts (Figure 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/Tpt8s2c.jpeg\" width=\"500\"><br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 2: Screen from ANTARES favourites.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cross-Access with ALeRCE**  \n",
    "ANTARES does not allow data downloads, so I retrieved the same object's light curve and classification via ALeRCE, linked directly from the ANTARES interface (Figure 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/4ylsC3z.png\" width=\"450\"><br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 3: Screen from ANTARES linking to ALeRCE.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Photometric Variability Analysis**  \n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/egZ2rGl.png\" width=\"500\"><br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 4: Screen from ALeRCE.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "From the ALeRCE page (Figure 4), I downloaded all the data necessary for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Spectroscopic Comparison**  \n",
    "To verify the variability of the object, I examined the non-sky-subtracted spectroscopic data, focusing on the Hα line region. I selected seven spectra spanning approximately three months that exhibit pronounced changes in both line intensity and profile shape (Figure 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/Sm23NqV.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 6: Example of spectral variability in the Hα line. Variations in both intensity and profile shape are visible across different epochs.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals significant variability in the Hα profile, both in intensity and shape, confirming the presence of dynamic physical processes such as variable mass accretion. This behavior was reported by [Bonito et al. (2020)](#bonito2020) and is consistent with known variability patterns in young stellar objects. All the spectra that I used were pre-normalized and pre-trimmed by Dr. Bonito.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Spectroscopic Analysis and Sky Contribution**\n",
    "Next, I performed a quantitative comparison between sky-subtracted and non-sky-subtracted spectra from the Gaia-ESO Survey (Data Release 4) for NGC 2264. This comparison evaluates how sky subtraction affects spectral diagnostics, particularly in regions with strong nebular emission.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Bonito et al. (2020)](#bonito2020), Hα profiles may be divided into the following classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Good cases (confident accretors):**\n",
    "  - FWZI(Hα) > 14 Å  \n",
    "  - Broad emission profile  \n",
    "  - Possible spurious absorption caused by over-subtraction of nebular lines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bad cases (non-accretors):**\n",
    "  - FWZI(Hα) < 3 Å  \n",
    "  - Strong nebular contamination\n",
    "\n",
    "Before analyzing stellar spectra, I inspected ten pure-sky spectra to measure the wavelength range of maximum nebular Hα emission (Figure 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/91ZlMEO.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 7: Example of a sky spectrum around the Hα region.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean values obtained:\n",
    "- **Mean λ_min**: 6562.20 Å  \n",
    "- **Mean λ_max**: 6563.90 Å  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this reference, the analysis of non-sky-subtracted spectra can begin, focusing specifically on the shape and extent of the Hα profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/sirzlf0.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 8: Sky-subtracted spectrum classified as a medium case. Over-subtraction produces spurious absorption in the Hα line.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The sky-subtracted spectrum shows over-subtraction artifacts (Figure 8), preventing any reliable FWZI measurement. Therefore, the non-sky-subtracted spectrum was analyzed instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the **Full Width at Zero Intensity (FWZI)**, I identified the wavelengths where the emission line rises above and returns to the continuum. These points (λ_min and λ_max) were determined by measuring deviations of at least 5% above the continuum.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/mckIpSs.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 9: Non-sky-subtracted spectrum. Nebular emission dominates near the peak.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracted parameters:\n",
    "- **λ_min** = 6561.95 Å  \n",
    "- **λ_max** = 6564.30 Å  \n",
    "- **FWZI** = 2.35 Å  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since FWZI < 3 Å, this object is classified as a **non-accretor**. Additionally, nebular contamination dominates the Hα peak, preventing further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Confirmed Accretor (Good Case)**\n",
    "A second object, identified as a Class II accretor by [Venuti et al. (2018)](#venuti2018), was analyzed to validate the methodology. Figure 10 compares sky-subtracted and non-sky-subtracted spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/fSNUsV0.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 10: Sky-subtracted (pink) vs. non-sky-subtracted (black) spectra. Grey regions indicate strong nebular contamination.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Both spectra show nearly identical Hα profiles, confirming minimal nebular contamination except in the region marked in grey. Therefore, FWZI measurements are reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/pODeNlb.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 11: Non-sky-subtracted spectrum with identified λ_min and λ_max for FWZI measurement.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "From these boundaries, the following diagnostics were computed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FWZI** = 19.95 Å  \n",
    "- **Hα 10% width** = 578.26 km/s  \n",
    "- **v_blue** = –446 km/s  \n",
    "- **v_red** = +466 km/s  \n",
    "- **log Ṁ_acc (Natta 2004)** = –7.28  \n",
    "\n",
    "All results agree with the VizieR catalog associated with [Bonito et al. (2020)](#bonito2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mass Accretion Rate Estimation**\n",
    "To estimate the accretion rate, I followed the method described in [Natta et al. (2004)](#natta2004). Since their calibration was designed for brown dwarfs, I adapted the empirical constants using confirmed accretors from the VizieR catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression between log Ṁ_acc and FWZI is shown in Figure 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/LUz599u.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 12: Regression of log Ṁ_acc vs. Hα FWZI.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Derived relation:\n",
    "log(Ṁ_acc) = 0.406 × FWZI – 14.823\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this calibration, the accretion rate for the object is:\n",
    "- **log Ṁ_acc (new)** = –6.88  \n",
    "\n",
    "This matches the values from the VizieR catalog, confirming the robustness of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Future Perspectives**\n",
    "This report aims to highlight the potential of future surveys, in particular the **Rubin LSST**, for the study of YSOs. Rubin will act as a **discovery machine**, revealing long-term variable objects such as EXors. As an example, I explored the case of a reported EXor-like object.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the broker ALeRCE, I downloaded the data of the object's light curve and visualized it in Figure 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://imgur.com/kXguevH.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <em><small>Fig 13: Light curve of an EXor-like object, downloaded via ALeRCE.</small></em>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few confirmed EXor-type systems, but with the LSST survey it will be possible to discover many new candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rubin LSST will revolutionize YSO studies by:\n",
    "- Discovering large populations of EXor-type outbursts (months-long events)  \n",
    "- Enabling statistical analyses of episodic accretion across young clusters  \n",
    "- Facilitating prompt spectroscopic follow-up via broker alerts and 4MOST  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Discussion and Conclusion**\n",
    "This report presents a simulation of the future Rubin LSST–4MOST synergy, focusing on the analysis of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the NGC 2264 region. I investigated photometric and spectroscopic variability, using the Hα emission line and nearby forbidden lines as diagnostic tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to verify the variability of a YSO by monitoring the evolution of its Hα profile across different times. Moving toward a more quantitative analysis, I examined the spectra of two different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first object represents a **medium case**, where the sky-subtracted spectrum exhibited spurious absorption features caused by the over-subtraction, while the non-sky-subtracted spectrum was strongly contaminated by nebular emission. This prevented any reliable measurement of FWZI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second object was a **good case**: it showed two nearly identical spectra, with nebular contamination restricted to a region that does not interfere with the diagnostic line. This allowed reliable extraction of physical parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, I focused on estimating the mass accretion rate, adapting existing calibrations to this dataset using data from the VizieR catalog associated with [Bonito et al. (2020)](#bonito2020). From the FWZI values, I developed a custom calibration for log Ṁ_acc and applied it successfully to well-classified sources, obtaining consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of analysis enables a rapid classification of cluster members and reduces the volume of data requiring deeper spectroscopic investigation. Although the methodology was demonstrated with only two objects, it represents a powerful tool for identifying accretors statistically within large datasets; this is a useful capability in the Rubin LSST era.\n",
    "\n",
