As a Rubin LSST data rights holder, I developed methods to identify accretion signatures in archival spectra and correlated these features with photometric variability. The Hα line serves as a key diagnostic for accretion processes, mass-loss activity, and the evolutionary stages of pre-main-sequence stars."
