    "# **Variability of Young Stellar Objects — Internship Report**  \n",
    "**Author:** Chiara Virzì  \n",
    "**Date:** April 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This report outlines the work I conducted during my internship under the supervision of Dr. Rosaria Bonito at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo. The focus of the internship was the analysis of variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), using both photometric and spectroscopic data, in preparation for the upcoming Rubin LSST survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **1. Introduction**  \n",
    "The aim of this project is to study spectral variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), with a focus on the Hα emission line, across timescales of several months. As a Rubin LSST data rights holder, I developed methods to identify accretion signatures in archival spectra and correlated these features with photometric variability. The Hα line serves as a key diagnostic for accretion processes, mass-loss activity, and the evolutionary stages of pre-main-sequence stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "# **2. Young Stellar Object Science**  \n",
    "YSOs are stars in their early formation stages, that are still undergoing contraction and that are typically surrounded by disks of gas and dust. These stars are known for their strong variability, driven by accretion, magnetic activity, and interactions with surrounding circumstellar material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **YSO Evolutionary Classes**  \n",
    "YSOs are classified based on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs), that are a plot of energy versus frequency or wavelength of light.\n",
    "These are the types of classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class 0**: Deeply embedded protostars, observed mainly in the submillimeter range.  \n",
    "- **Class I**: Protostars with infalling envelopes, showing strong infrared excess, outflows and jets.  \n",
    "- **Class II**: Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTS) with developed accretion disks and active mass transfer.  \n",
    "- **Class III**: Weak-lined T Tauri Stars (WTTS) with little or no disk and minimal accretion signatures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "https://ay201b.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/article-interpreting-spectral-energy-distributions-from-young-stellar-objects-2/\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Class II and III sources is crucial for studying late-stage star formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Eruptive variable stars**  \n",
    "Eruptive variable stars display irregular or semi-regular brightness variations, often triggered by the loss or accretion of material,like the accretion process observed in YSOs, where streams from the surrounding disk flow into the protostar. Unlike regular pulsating stars, eruptive variables undergo sudden outbursts, during which material is violently ejected, leading to abrupt changes in brightness. These eruptions typically originate in the chromosphere or corona. Accretion bursts, a hallmark of these type of stars, are episodic events where disk material rapidly accretes onto the stellar surface, causing temporary increases in brightness and temperature. During these phases, localized hot spots dominate the UV/blue spectrum. Different photometric bands respond uniquely to these events:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **u/g bands**: Trace hot-spot and shock emission(signal of variability).  \n",
    "- **i/z bands**: Sensitive to extinction changes and disk occultation (geometry of the sistem).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Short-Term Variability**  \n",
    "This tyepe of phenomena are observed over hours to days. They are often caused by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Magnetic reconnection flares  \n",
    "- Unstable accretion streams  \n",
    "- Jet or outflow activity\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Long-Term Variability**  \n",
    "Changes that occur over months to years,way longer than \"normal bursts\", such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **EXors**: Irregular, months-long outbursts (e.g., EX Lupi)  \n",
    "- **FUors**: Decade-long outbursts caused by inner disk instabilities (e.g., FU Orionis)\n",
    "At this time there are very few examples of these type of stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Light Curves**  \n",
    "Light curves track stellar brightness over time. It provides insights into different types of variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Periodic variability** from rotation or disk warps.  \n",
    "- **Aperiodic variability** from changing accretion or extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report I used the data from ZTF (Zwicky transient facility).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Spectroscopy and the Hα Line**  \n",
    "Spectroscopy provides direct information on the physical processe, like accretion and stellar winds. The Hα line at 6562.8 Å is important for identifying accretion activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broad profile** indicate magnetospheric infall or outflow.  \n",
    "- **Narrow profiles** typically indicate chromospheric emission from stars with a non-accreting disk (like Class III) .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Full Width at Zero Intensity (FWZI) measures the total emission-line width from continuum departure to return and serves as a proxy for maximum gas velocities in the line-forming region.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Reipurth et al. (1996)](#reipurth1996) proposed that the width of Hα at 10% of peak is a strong accretion indicator, with further refinement by [Venuti et al. (2014)](#venuti2014) to distinguish accreting and non-accreting stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **3. Rubin LSST and 4MOST**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Rubin Observatory’s LSST** (Legacy Survey of Space and Time) will image the sky in six bands (*u, g, r, i, z, y*) over ten years, enabling both short- and long-term variability studies.  \n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important project will be the **4MOST** facility that will provide spectroscopic follow-up. \n",
    "In the report I used the data from the NGC 2264 region also observed by Gaia-ESO—serves as a test for the Rubin–4MOST synergy.\n",

    "To evaluate the best observing strategy to be adopted for the YSO science, star forming regions ,like  NGC 2264, were proposed for the LSST survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Brokers**  \n",
    "Data brokers are real-time platforms that process alert streams from surveys like LSST. Their role includes filtering, cross-matching, classification, and alert distribution to the community. They allow the scientific community to access photometric data. \n",
    "\n",
    "I explored two major brokers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ANTARES**: enables real-time alert browsing and favoriting of objects, allowing users to monitor an object and perform spectroscopic follow-up in case of interesting variability.\n",
    "- **ALeRCE**: offers light curves, forced photometry, and machine learning-based classifications through classifiers capable of identifying 15 different object types.(https://alerce.science/alerce-pipeline/)\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are currently using **ZTF** data, serving as prototypes for LSST.\n",

    "There are few examples of EXor-type, but with the LSST survey it will be possible to discover new objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Discovering large populations of EXor-type outbursts (months-long events)  \n",
    "- Enabling statistical analyses of episodic accretion across clusters  \n",
    "- Facilitating prompt spectroscopic follow-up via broker alerts and 4MOST  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Discussion and Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This report presents a simulation of the future Rubin LSST–4MOST synergy, focusing on the analysis of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the NGC 2264 region. I investigated both photometric and spectroscopic variability, using the Hα emission line and nearby forbidden lines as diagnostic tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to verify the variability of a YSO by monitoring how its Hα line evolves over time. Moving toward a more quantitative analysis, I examined the spectra of two distinct objects. The first object represents a bad case: in particular, its sky-subtracted spectrum exhibited absorption features likely caused by over-subtraction, while the corresponding non-sky-subtracted spectrum was also unsuitable for further analysis due to dominant nebular noise overpowering the stellar signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the second object—deliberately selected as a good case—presents two nearly identical spectra. Furthermore, the region most affected by nebular contamination does not interfere with our diagnostic line, thereby confirming the reliability of the data. Proceeding with a more detailed analysis, I calculated several physical parameters of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, I focused on the mass accretion rate, adapting existing calibrations to our specific case using data collected from the VizieR catalog of [Bonito et al. (2020)](#bonito2020). Using FWZI I developed a custom calibration for the mass accretion rate and applied it to well-classified sources, obtaining consistent and meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of analysis enables rapid classification of cluster members, significantly reducing the volume of data that requires deeper examination.\n",
    "Although this methodology was demonstrated using only two objects, it represents a potentially powerful tool for statistically identifying accretors across large stellar populations.\n",
