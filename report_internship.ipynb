    "# **Variability of Young Stellar Objects Internship Report**\n",
    "Author:**Chiara Virzì**\n",
    " Date:April 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report I am going to describe my internship's topics, all the work done with my tutor Dr.Rosaria Bonito  at Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Introduction**\n",
    "Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are stars in the early stages of stellar evolution. YSOs can be identified by their variability, and in this report, we focus on the spectral analysis of the Hα band, which allows us to investigate the activity of the accretion disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Young Stellar Object Science**\n",
    "Through spectroscopic analysis, YSOs can be categorized into four main classes based on their luminosity and spectral characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class 0**: Earliest stage of protostar development, deeply embedded in their molecular cloud and mostly detected at submillimeter wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class I**: These stars exhibit high luminosity and possess a prominent, active accretion disk. At this stage, accretion activity is strong, and jets or outflows are often observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class II**: These stars are more evolved and have a well-defined protoplanetary disk. Although the disk is less massive, accretion onto the star is still ongoing. These are also known as Classical T Tauri stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class III**: These are the most evolved among YSOs, with very little or no remaining accretion disk. They represent the transition between pre-main-sequence and main-sequence stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "YSOs are critical for understanding the processes of star formation and planetary system evolution. In this report, the focus will be on analyzing Class II and Class III objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Accretion Bursts**\n",
    "Accretion bursts are sudden, brief increases in luminosity caused by material falling onto a young star from its circumstellar disk. These bursts release energy primarily in the form of thermal radiation, and are often detected at infrared wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *u* and *g* photometric bands are particularly effective for detecting accretion-related variability in YSOs, as accretion hotspots emit at higher temperatures. Conversely, variability in the *i* band is useful for identifying dips caused by occultations from circumstellar disk material. These \"dippers\" are usually associated with dust extinction, which becomes more noticeable at longer wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Light Curves**\n",
    "A light curve is a plot of an object's brightness over time in different photometric bands. By studying their shapes and variations, astronomers can identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Periodicity**: Suggesting rotation or disk-related variability.\n",
    "- **Transients**: Sudden changes in brightness, such as accretion bursts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Photometric monitoring is often accompanied by spectroscopic follow-up, especially for detecting accretion disks. In fact, distinguishing between Class II and Class III YSOs is primarily possible through spectral analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Spectroscopy and the Hα Band**\n",
    "Spectroscopy plays a central role in the classification and study of YSOs. It allows us to analyze specific spectral lines, which is a key indicator of accretion activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hα emission line is produced by the recombination of ionized hydrogen in the circumstellar environment. A broad, strong Hα line typically signifies active accretion, while a weak or absent line indicates a more evolved object with little accretion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in Reipurth et al. (1996), the shape, width, and intensity of the Hα line can be used to distinguish between active and passive disks, as well as to infer physical parameters such as accretion rates and radial velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Brokers**\n",
    "Data brokers play a key role in modern astronomical research by streamlining the acquisition, filtering, and distribution of massive datasets generated by wide-field surveys. In the context of studying Young Stellar Objects and transient phenomena, brokers enable real-time aggregation and cross-matching of alerts from multiple instruments and wavelengths. This ensures that potentially significant events, such as accretion bursts or changes in spectral features, are promptly identified and disseminated to the scientific community. By reducing the data processing burden on individual researchers, brokers facilitate timely follow-up observations and collaborative efforts, ultimately accelerating discovery and enhancing our understanding of stellar evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Methods**\n",
    "In this study, I focused on learning how to analyze the spectral characteristics of Young Stellar Objects. In particular, I investigated the conditions under which meaningful information can be extracted from their spectra and the methods used to interpret these data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis was based on a set of FITS files provided as part of a study on the galaxy NGC 2264, a well-known star-forming region observed within the Gaia-ESO Survey. \n",

    "# **Discussion**\n",
    "By subtracting the sky-subtracted and non-sky-subtracted spectra, we found that in Object 1, the nebular noise overwhelmed the signal, rendering the data unreliable. Additionally, the width of the Hα line did not exceed the 3 Å threshold, as recommended by Bonito et al. (2020). This indicates that Object 1 is a bad case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Object 2 showed a near-perfect match between the sky-subtracted and non-sky-subtracted spectra. The analysis also revealed that the presence of an internal absorption line complicated the automatic determination of λ min. This absorption minimum is indicative of an object with an Hα line of type IV, as described by Reipurth et al. (1996). To resolve this, the code was adjusted to stop at the first minimum to ensure the correct identification of λ min.\n",
    "To address this issue, the value of λ min was forced not to exceed 6550 Å, ensuring that the entire Hα line profile was considered.\n",
    "Furthermore, the width of the Hα line for Object 2 exceeded 14 Å, which confirms its reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Conclusion**\n",
    "In summary, the approach developed in this study allows for the identification of the Hα band even in the presence of internal absorption lines. The analysis conducted allows for the study of large quantities of objects. However, in this case, the validity of the results was also supported by visual inspection to verify each outcome.\n",
